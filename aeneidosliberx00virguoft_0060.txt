298. quae talia] pleonastie. ‘ These words to this effect.'

299. tonsis] so remis insumimus, iii. 207, v. 189. The case
is abl. of instr. as is seen by comparing Rutil. itin. i. 399,
remis surgere certamus, where the simple verb is used.

301. sedere] pf. of sedeo used for the pf. of sido, which is
uncommon.

303. dorso] a bank of sand, so called from its resemblance
to a back ; compare our names, The Hog's Baek, Saddleback.

304. fatigat] buffets the waves as they beat against it.

308-361. leefigylzt beslius. Aeneaskills Theron, Lichas, Cisseus,

310. sig-na] subject to canunt: ‘the trumpets sound.'
agrestis] the countrymen were on the side of Turnus.

311. omen pugnae] a clause in the nom. in apposition to
the sentence. The fact that Aeneas takes the offensive
augurs success, Cp. Liv. xxi. 29. 4, hoe principium simul
omenque belli victoriam Romanis portendit.

313. perque per] = per suta ec per tunicam, the repetition
of per is equivalent to the repetition of the copula. Cp. xii.
548, totae adeo conversae acies omnesque Latini, Ι omnes
Dardanidae.

314. squalentem] his ‘tunica' is stiff with gold, being
worked with eloth of gold. The commentators explain
tunicam as a shirt of mail or corselet, but (1) such a meaning
of tunica, seems unsupported, (2) and then the aerea suta will
refer to the same, i.e. ‘ per tunicam aereis sutis et auro squalenti
consertam.' But the emphatic repetition of per is against
this, and rather indicates that the sword passes first through
the corseiet, then through the shirt embroidered with gold
thread worn beneath, and lastly wounds his side thus laid
bare (apertum). haurit] we speak of a sword drinking

blood.

316. Children ripped from the dead mother’s womb were
sacred to Phoebus ‘the healer’ (παιώνιος), as having been

saved from death.
