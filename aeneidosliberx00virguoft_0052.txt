42 VERG. AEN. X.

147. contulerant] The plupf. indicates that the battle,
which went on by day, is now over. Aeneas is returning
during the night. The story is continued from viii. 607.
Aeneas had gone to visit Tarchon, prince of Caere (who was
acting as leader of the Etruscans in revolt against their king
Mezentius), and had secured their alliance.

148. ab Euandro] ‘leaving Evander.' ingressus is parti-
ciple, and the apodosis to ut begins at haud fit mora, l. 153.
castris] dat, where prose would require acc.‚ cp. inf. 763.
This construction seems to have been first used by Vergil.

150. The disjunctive conjunctions (-ve -ve) are used because
Verg. is thinking of the series of questions as put by

Tarchon.

151. The violent passionate nature of Turnus is the point in
his character specially emphasized by Virgil. See N ettle-

ship's Essays, pp. 113, 131.

152. quae sit] ‘how little confidence human fortunes can
command.' Tarchon himself may some day be in need of

help, as he, Aeneas, now is.

154. foedusque ferit] Liv. i. 24 explains this phrase. The
official who formally concluded the treaty symbolized it by
the slaughter of a pig, with the wordS‚ ‘If the Roman
people break the treaty, then Juppiter strike them (turn
illo dle, Diespiter, populum Romanum sic ferito). as I to-day
strike this pig? fati] gen. in imitation of the Greek use
after ἐλεύθερος.· cp.H0r. A. P. 212, liber laborum, Liv. v. 28. l,
voti liberari. The gen. of the ‘thing in point of which' is
freely used by poets, R. 526. The Etruscans were now ‘ quit
of destiny‚’ free from the obligation they owed to destiny‚ as
they had chosen a foreign leader according to the orac-le given
to them, viii. 503, externos optate duces. This is explained by

l. 156.

155. gens Lydia] The Etruscans of Caere, supposed to be
of Lydian origin.

156. puppis] synecdoche for the whole ship.

157. subiuncta] governs leones, sup. 133 n.‚ ‘having a pair
of lions joined to its beak beneath’ A lion (the animal
sacred to Cybele, under whose special patronage the Trojans
were) is painted or carved on each side of the lower
part of the prow, immediately below the beak, and above
