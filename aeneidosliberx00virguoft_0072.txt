62 VERG. AEN. X.

650. Cp. the message of King Harold of England to King
Harold of Norway. The English king will give the Norseman
“seven feet of the ground of England, or more perchauce,
seeing he is taller than other meu'’ (Freeman, Old English
History‚ p. 313).

653. crepidine] abl. of means : the simple abl. with coniungyo
is not uncommon (see e.g. Cic. p. Cluent.‚ ξ 13) : ‘moored by
means of a projection of rock‚' i.e. to a projecting rock.

654. The pons is the gangway 01· landing-stage‚ which runs
across from the shore to the ship: the scalae are the ship’s
ladder, by which the high side is mounted from the pons.
Thus in 658, moras pl. is used with reference to these two
hindrances.

11660. revoluta per aequora] ‘ on the retiring wave ' (Nettle-
S 611311. But the real Aeneas in the meanwhile is searching for
Turnus, and slaying as he searches. This is parenthetical ; at

666. salutis] objective gen. depending on inyratus, which
is not elsewhere found with a gen.‚ though qratia with a gen.
occurs in Livy. The construction was no doubt suggested to
Verg. by {auarus rerum, which inm-acus salutis balancas, and
which is perfectly regular. R. 525.

668. tanton] z tantone. Notice the elision of e before acon-
sonant3 it was probably colloquial in its origin, and is com-
mon in the older poets. Vergil uses Pyrrhia = Pyrrhine (iii.

ν 319), and mortalia = mortaline (xii. 797).

670. quemve] ‘ what ssight is this that takes me from the
fight, or who am Ι that fly?' Cp. Cic. Lael. §132 sed quis
eqo sum aut quae est in mefacultas?

672. quid] ‘ what will become of ’.θ’ The language of Turnus
is abrupt owing to excitement, hence the verb is suppressed,
or not clearly conceived. So vii. 365, quid tua sanctafides ,9
= ‘ what has become of your solemn pledge ? ’

673. quosne] the interrogative particle, which properly
should stand in a principal clause, is placed in the interrog-
ative clause. This negligence is also significant of the excite-
ment of Turnus, and similarly appears in excited passages in
