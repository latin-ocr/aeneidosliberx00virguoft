l·l5. Juppicer calls a council of the yocls, and urgyes them to
deser cheir quam-el until the appointed time, when Carthaye
shall make war on Rome.

1. interea] ‘and now,' while the events related in the last
book had been going on: used loosely to express transition,
as the council clearly takes place after the events.

‘The house of heaven opens' implies the beginning of a
fresh day, day (Le, the sun who brings it) being conceiv ed of
as issuing from heaven, into which at night it is shut again

(i. 374, clauso Olympo).

3. sideream in sedem] Hom. Il. 19. 128, ἐς Οὔλυμπόν τε
καὶΙ οὐρανὸν ἀστεροέντα.

5. bipatentibus] cp. Eur. Med. 135, ἐπ’ ἀμφιπὺλου μελάθρου,
‘the double-gated court.’ Heaven is regarded as a stately
temple, with a gate at either end, i. e.‚ east and west, through
one of which the sun emerges in the morning, and returns
through the other at night. It is through these two gates
tlhat the gods have a view down of what is going on on earth.

8. abnueram] ‘ Ι had been averse to) Juppiter had been
averse to the Italians opposing the Trojans, as is indicated by
the words of J uno vii. 312, flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta
movebo ‚· and by ix. 799-803‚ where it is said that Juno had
withdrawn Turnus from attacking the Trojans in consequence
of a message sent her from J uppiter by Iris. This is not incon-
sistent with the fact that in his omniscience hc fore-knew that
the war would take place, and in i. 263 had prophesied that
Aeneas should wage war on and crush the Italians.
