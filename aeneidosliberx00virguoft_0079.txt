NOTES. ’ 69

tardare et commorari tc melius esset ? (The conjecture tarda cst
adopted by Deuticke is very plausible.)

858. hoc] i.e. the horse, attracted to the gender of decus.
The affection of Mezentius, the cruel tyrant, for his horse is
striking. Vergil, with a great writer's truth to nature,
does not paint his bad characters without redeeming
features.

867. consueta locavit membra] ‘ took his wonted seat)

872. This line, as well as l. 871, occurs again xii. 667-668,
where both lines are suitable. Here, though the former
comes in well, the latter is not applicable to Mezentius, and
furthermore is omitted here in the best MSS„ from which it is
clear that it was inserted here by some scribe from xii. 668.
It should therefore be rejected.

874. enim is here an emphasising particle ε ‘ Aeneas recog-
nised him full well) Cp. vi. 317, Aeneas miratus enim motus-
que tumultu.

875. sic] regular in adjurations, implies a condition, as
we might say, ‘so may Juppiter bring it about, (as Ι hope for

877. effatus] sc. est, 162 note.

880. nec divom parcimus uni] is in keeping with the fero-
city of the character of Mezentius, ‘ scorner of the gods ⁵ : he
says, ‘I give quarter to no g0d‚' not even if ‹Juppiter and
Apollo, whom you invoke, come to aid you in the fight.

885. He rides round Aeneas, facing towards his left, so as
to keep his left hand, which is protected by his shield,
towards Aeneas.

887. silvam] a forest of weapons. For a similarly exag-
gerated expression, cp. Ov. P. I. ii. 21, tecta riyent fixis veluti
vallata cassinis.

889. iniqua] because Aeneas is on foot, Mezentius on
horseback.

892. calcibuS‚ ete] ‘paws the air with its feet, and
throwing its rider, falls over him itseIf, and hampers him,
and with head bowed forwards, lies upon him with its own
shoulder dislocated.' Henry compares Silius x. 255, cum
