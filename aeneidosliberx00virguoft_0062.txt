52 VERG. AEN. X.

362-438. In another place tlte Arcadian hor-semen, fiyhtinq
in the dry bed of a torrent, are compellat to ‹lismozmt. They
beqin to aive way, and are rallied by Pallas, who, after other
siauyhter, at last kills Halaesus, who had himself done some
destruction. Lausus rallies the Rutulians. He and Pallas
meet, but do not fiylzt.

363. diruta ripis] ‘ torn from its banks.'
365. Latio]=Latinis, the country for the people.

366. quis (=quibus) quando] is usually explained as a
pleonasm for quando eis, ep. Greek αὖθις αὖ παλιν. But it
is simpler to take quando as equivalent to aliquando
(Priscian), ‘since the rough nature of the ground had at
length led theru to diseard their horses.'

369. per vos] ‘ by yourselves and your brave deeds.' There
is a similar personal appeal inf. 597. (The usual view which
makes vos governed by oro understood, vos oro per et· fortia
facta, per ducis etc. :vos oro per et f. f. et ducis, like the Greek
πρός σε γονάτων, is intolerably harsh.)

370. devicta bella] ‘ the wars that you have won.’

371. ‘and by my promise that now aspires to rival my
father's glory.'

374. alta] ‘noble’ reposcit] ‘ bids us return' (re-).

378. deest] synizesis. pelagus Troiamne petamus ἲ] a
rhetorical double question, to which the answer is no. Shall
we throw ourselves into the sea, where is no escape for us, or
shall we flee for refuge to that very camp, New Troy, which
we have come to relieve? No, we must fight3 and suiting
the action to the word densos prorumpit in hostis. For the
rarer form of double question, where -ne introduces the second
question, and no particle the first, see Bradley's Arnold, § 159.

379. medius] transferred from hosti-3 to Pallas, ‘into the
serried ranks of the foe.'

382. discrimina] ‘where the spine made the division be-
tween the ribs running down the back) Notice dabat .· the
lengthening of the final syllable is not a poetic lieenee, but a
return to the original quantity -ᾱι in impf. indic. Virg. uses
it so only in arsis.

384. super] ‘above him.’ Pallas stoops to draw out his

spear, and Hisbo tries to take him at an advantage from
a ove.
