by destiny of a kind: but of what kind? It was the mere

71. Tyrrhenam fidem agitare] ‘to tamper with the loyalty
of the Etruscans’ towards their savage king Mezentius, who

Aeneas, which June, with rhetorical carelessness, misstates
as if he had incited them to rebel.

is contemptuously repeated.

76. avus] used loosely, as inf. 619, he is called Turnus’
