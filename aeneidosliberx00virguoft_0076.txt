66 VERG. AEN. X.

781. alieno] ‘meant for another.' caelumque] the hyper-
metric que is elided before the initial vowel of the next line:
cp. 895. Such elision is uncommon.

784. aere triplici] descriptive abl. ι ‘ the hollow disk of
triple-plated bronze.' For terqa see on 482. The layer of flax
seems to come between the bronze and the bull’s hide ; possibly
its use was to compact these two together.

785. ima] ‘low down.'

786. vires haud. pertulit] ‘did not carry its force home '
(Nettleship).

792. ⁴ If any antiquity can ever gain belief for so great a
deed.’ Mere antiquity from a poet's point of view is one of the
strongest grounds for believing in ancient legends. So Ovid,
speaking of the stones thrown by Deucalion and Pyrrha being
changed into human beings, says (M. i. 400) quis hoc credat,
nisi sic pro teste vetustas?

794. inutilis inque ligatus] ‘powerless and hampered’ by
his spear. The two parts of isalz‘qatfzas are separated (tmesis,
R. 945) : this is common in Greek, and not infrequent in old
Latin, and especially in Lucretius, whom Verg. often imitatas.
Elsewhere Verg. has septem subiecta trioni: septemtrioni (G. iii.
381) ; hac celebrata tenuszhaccemcs (Aen. v. 603) 3 inque salu-
tatam (xi. 288).

796. armis] ‘the fight.’

798. morando sustinuit] ‘ stayed him with the check ' ς the
mora or check which Lausus' bravery interposed held back
(sustinuit) Aeneas’ charge (Sidgwick).

800. dum abiret] ‘until he should retire': dum, ‘untiL’
regularly takes subj. when it refers not to time merely, but to
time as purposed in the mind of somebody. Here it is their
purpose to cover his retreat : R. 692. Cp. inf. 809. Note the
change of sequence in abiret after secuntur: the past tense is
used because the poet throws himself back into the past, to the
time of the event.

802. tectus] reflexive: ‘ covering himself (with his shield)
holds himself in.'

804 diffugit] pf. of instantaneous act: cp. sup. 711. Notice
the rhyme arator, viator (Homoeoteleuton, R. 948): Verg. is
not averse to such rhymes, e. g. ii. 124, 125, carebant, videbant,-
