Ν OTES. 39

94. tuis] dat„ as we say ‘to sear f0r‚’ R. 474. querellis]
abl. of circumstance, ‘ with groundless complaints.’

96-117. A tumult follows Juno’s words ; then ,Iuppiter speaks.
Since the strise between the 90ch is endless, he will noc inter-
fere, but will let destc'ny take its course.

97. adsensu vario] some agreeing with Venus, some with
J uno. flamina prima] ‘ rising gusts of wind.’
. 98. The noise is compared to the moaning of the wind
before a storin, hence fremunt contains the point of the
simile. caeca] ‘stifled‚’ of sound confined. The word,
properly applieable to sight, is transferred with poetic force
to sound.

101. eo] the forms eum, eam, eo, εᾶ, eos from is are not
common in the Augustali poets, eas and eins are rare, ei,
eorum, earum, eis are avoided (see my note on Ov. T. iii. 4. 27).

102. solo] ‘in respect of its foundation’: both domus and
tellus are nom. to silescit.

103. Zephyri] The name of one wind is put for the winds
in general. posuere] ‘ fell) Intrans. as in vii. 27, cum venti
posuere. premit placida] ‘ hushes to rest.’ The adj. placida
is proleptic, i.e. denotes the result brought about upon the
water-s: so iii. 237, scuta latentia condunt: ‘they hide their
shields out ofsi9l18.'

107. quam quisque secat spem] ‘whatever path of hope
each one carves out for himself.’ The metaphor in secat is
probably taken from cutting out a road : cp. vi. 898, ille viam
secat ad naves ; xii. 368, sic Turno, quacumque viam secat,
afflnina cedet-nt.

108. fuat] z sit, archaia form from same stem as fici,
frequent in Plautus, found in this place only in Verg.
The subjunctive is due to the indireet question, for the
double form of which see Bradley's Arnokl, ἓ 168. nullo
discrimine] abl. of circumstance. ‘I will make no dis-
tinction whether he be Trojan or Rutulian.' ’

It 1199. fatis Italum] ‘in accordance with the destiny of the
a lans.

110. ῩἩιθῒᾸὶθῐ· the plight of the Trojans is due to a mistake
on their part, as Venus had said (31-33), oris due, as Juno
fficoztffilgtegged (68-73), to their following oracles blindly
