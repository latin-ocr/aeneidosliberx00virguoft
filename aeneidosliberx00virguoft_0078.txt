68 VERG. AEN. X.

832. de more] ‘regularly.’

833-908. Mezentius arietes bitterlyfor the death ofhis son, and
addresses ms ιῙὶιιόηνιέε horse Rhombus. He then figykts with
Aeneas, and is killed.

838. colla fovet.] The word fovere, properly ‘to keep warm‚’
is often used in medical writers of fomenting ; hence, as here,
it sometimes means ‘to wash' or ‘bathe' Cp. G. iv. 230,
prius haustu sparsus aquarum Ι ora fove (‘rinse'). Aen. xii.
420, fovit ea vulnus lympha yrandaevus Iapis. fusus barbam]
on the construction see 133 note.

839. muitum] = saepe.
841. arma] his shield.

84} ingentem ingenti] cp. Hom. 11. 12. 640, κεῖτο μέγας
με’γα ωστ .

844. He puts dust on his head as a sign of mourning.
845. corpore] 361 note.

850. exilium] ⁶ now at length is the misery of exile brought
home to me in my wretchedness‚' i.e. before with Lausus to
comfort 1ne Ι did not find exile so bitter. Most MSS. and editors
read exitium, which cannot be right as (l) it is the opposite of
what Mezentius would naturally say. Having lost all, death
to him would now be feline, rather than infelix: (2) demum
seems to indicate that something is spoken of which existed
before the death of Lausus, the bitterness of which, i.e. of exile,
Mezentius now fully realises in his lonely misery. volnus
adactum] ‘ now is the wound driven deep.’ I did not care for

the wound inflicted by Aeneas on myself 3 but this wound, my
son's death, Ι do feel.

853. debueram] ‘ Ι long ago had owed retribution)

854. dedissem] past jussive subj. used of advice applicable
to circumstances no longer existing3 R. 670. Cp. xi. 162,
Troum socia arma secutum 1 obruerent (‘ought to have over-
whelmed') Rutuli teli-s: animam ipse dedissem (‘I ought to
have yielded up’), Ι atque haec pompa domum me, non Pallanta,
referret (‘ ought to have been bearing back ').

857. quamquam vis alto volnere tardat] ‘although his
strength flags on account of his deep wound.’ Tardare is
usually transitive, but here must be intransitive, a use sup-
