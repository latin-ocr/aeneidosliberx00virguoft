INTRODUCTION.

AENEAS, son of Venus and Anchises, one of the
chief Trojan heroes, escaped with his father Anchises
and son Iulus, otherwise called Ascanius, and a con-
siderable body of followers, from the sack of Troy.
He built a fieet from timber cut on Mount Ida, and
sailed away westwards to found a fresh settlement.
Amongst other places he went to Delos, where he
received an oracle bidding him seek the place whence
his race sprung. Anchises wrongly interprets this to
be Crete, and the Trojans land there, but a pestilence
breaking out on their arrival terrifies them, and
causes them to leave the island. The Penates now
appear and say that Italy is the place intended by

> the oracle, as Dardanus, the founder of the Trojan

race, came from Italy. Accordingly to Italy Aeneas
and his followers sail, and after various wanderings,
in the course of which they visit Carthageâ€š arrive
in Italy from Africa and land at Cumae. Thence
Aeneas proceeds by sea to the mouth of the Tiber
