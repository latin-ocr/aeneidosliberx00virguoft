the poets often use the plupf. to indicate time long past (see
my note on Ov. Τ. I. i. 80). quin follows negares in the
sense of ‘refuse' Translate :—‘ Oh! had I but had that
power in love which once was mine, and which Ι ought to

have had ! for then you would not, almighty as you are, have
refused me this request, to be able to rescue Turnus from the

fight, and save him alive for his father Daunus.’
