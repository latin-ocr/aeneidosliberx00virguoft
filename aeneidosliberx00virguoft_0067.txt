NOTES. 57

fifty daughters of Danaus; but as Danaus had been warned
in an oracle that he would be killed by his own son-in-law,
he fied with his family to ArgOS, whither the sons of Aegyptus
pursued him. Here Danaus at last consented to the marriage,
but gave to each of his daughters a sword, with orders to kill
their respective husbands on the bridal night. All obeyed
except Hypermnestra, who spared her husband, Lynceus.
At una sub nocte the construction is changed ; instead of

· cae-sam manum thalamosque cruentos, which would have been

regular, for the sake of greater vividness the poet passes into
the nom. case as if he were relating the crime ‘ how that band
of youths was foully slain all on one wedding night, and the
nuptial chambers stained with gore.'

502. servare modum] ‘to keep within bounds.' Turnus
elated with success goes too far in spoiling the slain prinee,
and consequently incurs the vengeance of heaven (νέμεσις).

503. magno] the poet's answer to the proud words of
Turnus, haud illi stabunt Aeneia parco hospitia. ‘The day
will come when Turnus will have wished that he might have
paid a great price to have left Pallas unharmed,² lit. ‘will
have wished the unharmed Pallas bought for a great price.’
On intactum Pallanta, see on 143. The reference is to the
death of Turnus related in Book XII. ; then when Aeneas was
hesitating whether to spare him, he suddenly caught sight of
the belt of Pallas, and in anger slew him.

504. ista] ‘ these present spoils.'

505. On the metre see on sup. 136. Here the harshness of

the ending suggests the loud discord of lamentation that arises
over the fallen chief.

509. tamen] ‘ while yet thou leavest behind thee,' as a con-
solation. Tamen is often used to contrast with a misfortune
some consoling consideration : Aen. iv. 328, Dido complaining
of being deserted by Aeneas says si quis mihi parvulus aula!
luderet Aeneas, qui te tamen ore referret, 1 ηοη equidem
omnino capta ac deserta videre, (Ἥ some baby Aeneas had
been playing in my hall, whose face might yet in spite of all
recall thee, I should not have thought myself so utterly en-
snared and deserted ’).

510-605. News of what has happened reaches Aeneas, He 2⁸3
enrayecl at the death of Pallas, ancl comes to relieve elle Arcadi-
am. He (leals wide carnaqe, and burst-s· throuqh, and ‘releases
the beleaquered Troiane, and thas· raises che sieye of tlte camp.
