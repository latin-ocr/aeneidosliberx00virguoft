NOTES. 41

honestum is the acc. of direct object proper to the active
(caput detego), which is retained in poets in the passive (R.
471), possibly in imitation of the Greek usage, e. g. ἐπιτετραμ-
μένος τὴν ἀρχὴν (quoted by Sidgwick) ; and must be carefully
distinguished from the acc. of the part concerned (af³⁰·.⁰f

amque lacerto, ‘with satchels and slate slung from their left
arm.’ Cp. inf. 157, 838.

134. Ascanius is compared to a jewel set in gold, or to
ivory set in wood.

136. - Notice the prosody: (l) the hiatus, the ο of buxo being
unelided, (2) the four-syllabled word at the end of the line.
Both points are imitations of the Greek use, and are often
employed by Verg. to impart variety to his verse. Box-wood
is of a deep yellow-brown, terebinth of a rich black eolour,
thus both are well adapted for inlaying with ivory.

138. molli auro] abl. of means consti-noted with subnectit

(R. 499), ‘ a band confines them with pliant gold.' (Ribbeck
from many MSS. reads subnectens, cp. 210.)

139. magnanimae (μεγάθυμοι) gentes] the Lydian clans
which followed Ismarus.

140. volnera derigere] ‘ aiming wounds,' a variation on the
usual phrase spic-ula or tela (Ierigyere.

141. domo ubi] hiatus. domo is abl. of origin.

143. pristina] Mnestheus drove back Turnus, ix. 778 ff.
pulsi 'rurm gloria] ‘the glory consisting in the rout of
Turnus.’ The participle pulsi refers not so much to the
person acted on as to the act itself, and is to be rendered by
a substantive in English : it means not ‘ Turnus having been
routed,' but ‘the rout of Turnus’ (R. 560). Cp. inf. 504,
intactum Pallanta, ‘the leaving alone of Pallas'; ii. 413,
ereptae viminis ira, ‘wrath at the rescue of the maid'3 ii.
643, captae urbi, ‘the capture of the oity.' The gen. is of
definition (R. 523).

144. aggere moerorum] sup. 24.
145. urbi] Capua.
