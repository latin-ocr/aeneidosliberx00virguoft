NOTES. 49

277. praecipere depends 011 the verbal noun fiducia, ‘con-
fidence so as to seize beforehand .' This extension of the use
of the infin. is poetical: a gen. of the gerund would have
been used in prose. R. 540. 1. Cp. on 118.

278. This line being omitted in most of the best MSS„ and
being identieal with ix. 127, has probably been introduced
here from that passage.

280. iu manibus] ‘ the battle is actually in your hands, my

’ men.' Mars, the war—god, is used for that of which he is the

god. The meaning is : you have the opportunity of that hand-
to·hand fight which you desired; so that the words are an
expansion of l. 279. For in manibus cp. Sall. Ing. 57. 4,
cupere proelium z'n manibus facere ; Caes. B. G. ii. 19, ad
flumen decucurrerunt, ut paene uno tempore ec ad silvas et in
flumine et iam in manibus uostris hostes viderentur. (In manibus
Mars ipse viris, the reading of most MSS„ will mean, ‘brave
men have the war itseif in their hands ' ; but the ,ς in viris is
due no doubt to the s at the end of manibus.)

281. magna facta] ‘the mighty deeds that brought glory
to your fathers) Ec. iv. 26, heroum {condes et facta parentis.

283. trepidi] se. sunt.·‘(With cyressiqm, the reading of
some MSS. and edd., vestiqia is acc. of part eoncerned, R.
463 : ‘ totter as to their foot-steps.’)

284. A variation on the proverb, sortes fortuna adiuvat.
Ter. Phorm. Ι. iv. 26.

287-307. The Τ rojans land ,· Tarchon in doiny so shatters his
skip on a reefi

287. puppibus] sup. 268.

288. pontibus] instr. abl. Cp. 654. recursus lang-uentis
pelagi] ⁴ the ebb of the spent wave.'

290. per remos] they slide down the oars, which were
large galley oars, probably worked by two men.

291. ‘spying out a place where the waters are not heav-
ing.’ spirant] the heaving and panting of the waves is com-
pared to human breathing. fracta unda] breaker.

292. The sea ereeps in with the gradual rise of the tide.
