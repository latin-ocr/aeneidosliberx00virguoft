38 VERG. AEN. X.

79. soceros legere et gremiis abducere pactas] the plurals
are rhetorical: the reference is to Lavinia only, who was
claimed by Turnus as his plighted bride, but who had been
betrothed by her father to Aeneas on his lauding. Tho
reproach lies in Zeqere, ‘choose his own father-in-law,' the
custom being for the father-in-law to choose his own son-in-
law. (For premiis Ο. M'uller cleverly suggests generis.)

80. praefigere puppibus arma] ‘arm their ships for war.’
It appears that the arms were hung up in the sterns of the
ships. The voyage up the Tiber to Evander's town Pallanteum
is intended (viii. 92).

81. Juno is rhetorically inaccurate: Aphrodite saved

Aeneas by throwing the fold of her garment over him3 it
was Apollo who hid him in a cloud (Hom. Π, 5. 315, 344).

83. The fieet of Aeneas was built of timber from Mount
Ida in the Troad, which was sacred to Cybele, who besought
Juppiter that the ships might have the power of resisting
storms. This he refused, but promised that, when the voyage
was over, they should be turned into nymphs: which pro-
mise was effected (ix. 80). Thus potes is again a rhetorical
inaccuracy, as the miracle was not done by Venus.

87. gravidam bellis] ‘ teeming with ware)
88. tibi] ethic dat. ‘ Can you say that it is I who?’

89. qui] i.e. Paris, who by stealing away Helen caused the
Trojan war.

90. consurgere:cons—mvendi. The verb noun infinitive is
rarely used as a genitive depending on a noun, though Cicero
has racio amittere (=amictendz') occasionem (Caec. 5), quoted
by R. 540. The more usual genitive of the gerund is found
in Ec. i. 26, quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi. The
same variety of construction is found after cura .· Ov. P. iv. 3.
18, cura tibi cle quo quaerere nulla ficio: contrasted with M.

xiii. 764, iamque est tibi cura placendi.
91. foedera solvere furto] ‘ to loose the bonds of hospitality
by the theft' of Helen.

92. expugnavit] ‘stoi-med the Spartan home.' The act of
Paris is spoken of with rhetorical exagggeration.

H9l3. cupidine] ‘with passion,’ the passion of Paris for
e en.
