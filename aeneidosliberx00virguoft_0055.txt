NOTES . 45

196. minatur] ‘threatens the waves with a huge rock.’
Minatur here takes abl. of the thing with which, and dative
of the person threatened, as in xi. 348, licet arma mihi
mortemque minetur.

198. ille] demonstrative, inf. 274, 707. ‘There, too, Ocnus.'
The poet now gives a tradition about the origin of Mantua, in
the territory of which, at Andes, he was born.

199. 'rusci amnis] the Tiber, as in viii. 473, xi. 316. The
Tiber forms the western boundary of Etruria.

201. ‘Mantua, rich in forefathers‚ yet not of one blood
they a11; threefold is her race, with four townships ranged
under each 3 she herself chief among those townships, of
Tuscan blood her strength.’ The Etruscans lived originally
north of the Po, as is attested by the fact that Mantua re-
mained Etruscan down to a late period (Mommsen R. Η.
i. 130). She is the head of a confederacy of twelve townships
(populi, πόλεις), four of which (quaterni distributive) are com·
prised in each of the three races (flentes, ἔθνη) of which this
confederacy consists. These races were probably Greek,
Etruscan, and Umbrian. Tusco de sanguine vires] seems to
mean that the inhabitants of Mantua itself were chiefly,
though not necessarily entirely, Etruscan.

205. patre Benaco Mincius] A figure of the river-god
Mincius is the insiqne of the ship, as is Triton in 209, cp. 157.
The Mincius flows from the Benacus (Lago di Garda), thus

calloedhitslfather <patre B„ abl. of circumstance), past Mantua.
m e o.

206. infesta pinu] ship of war.

207. gravis] ‘ massive,' refers rather to the ship than the
man, as does adsurgens ‘ rising to the stroke.' centena has
no distributive force. arbore] ‘spar,' i.e. oar made from a
tree. Arbor is used for renat-9, as Aule-stes for navi-s A uleseae

(Metonymia, R. 949).
210. ‘ down to his waist his shaggy front shows the huma-n
form before him (praefert) as he swims’

212. The sibilation expresses the hissing of the water as the
ship shoots through it.

sormed, meet Aeneas, and one of them tells him co hasten ou, ew
